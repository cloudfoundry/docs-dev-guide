# Guide for Developers Pushing Apps to Cloud Foundry

This is a guide for developers on deploying and troubleshooting apps running in Cloud Foundry.

This is one of several repositories that go into a complete documentation set.

The contents here are structured as a topic repository intended to be compiled
into a larger document with
[Bookbinder](http://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bookbinder).

See the [docs-book-cloudfoundry](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-book-cloudfoundry)
repository for the complete list of open source documentation repositories, as well as information about the publishing process.

docs-dev-guide/deploy-apps subdirectory:

docs-dev-guide/capi subdirectory:

This repository used to contain the subdirectory docs-dev-guide/cf-cli, documenting the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). The content from this subdirectory has been moved to its own repository, [docs-cf-cli](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-cf-cli).
