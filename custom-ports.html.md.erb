title: Configuring Apps to Listen on Custom Ports (Beta)
owner: Routing
---

This topic describes how to configure your apps to listen for traffic on custom ports. 

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

By default, apps only receive requests on port 8080 for both HTTP and TCP routing. Configuring custom app ports allows developers to bring workloads onto Cloud Foundry (CF) that listen on ports other than 8080. Here are some example use cases:

* Serving web client requests on one port and offering stats/debug on another
* Using TCP protocols that require multiple ports 
* Running Docker images on CF 

The [Procedure](#procedure) below describes how to use the `apps` and `route_mappings` Cloud Controller API endpoints to update the ports the app can receive requests on. 

## <a id="prerequisite"></a> Prerequisite

Before following the procedure to configure routing to your app on custom ports, you must have the following:

* An app pushed to PCF that can listen on one or more custom ports. 
* **TCP only**: Routes mapped to each port you want your app to listen on. 
	For example, if you want your app to receive TCP connections on ports `1234` and `5678`, create two TCP routes:
		* One that maps `example.com:FIRST-RANDOM-PORT` to app port `1234`
		* Another that maps `example.com:SECOND-RANDOM-PORT` to app port `5678`

## <a id="procedure"></a> Procedure

To configure your app to receive HTTP or TCP traffic on custom ports, do the following:

1. Retrieve the GUID of your app:

	```
	cf APP-NAME --guid
	``` 
	Where `APP-NAME` is the name of your app

1. Add ports to your app:

	```
	cf curl /v2/apps/APP-GUID -X PUT -d '{"ports": [PORT1, PORT2, PORT3...]}'. 
	```
	Where:
	* `APP-GUID` is the GUID of your app
	*  `PORT1, PORT2, PORT3...` is a comma-separated list of the ports on which you want your app to receive traffic. 

1. Retrieve the GUID of the route to which clients will make requests for your custom port:

	```
	cf curl /v2/routes?q=host:APP-NAME
	```
	Where `APP-NAME` is the name of your app

1. Update the route mapping for your app:

	```
	cf curl /v2/route_mappings -X POST -d '{"app_guid": "APP-GUID", "route_guid": "ROUTE-GUID", "app_port": PORT1}'. 
	```
	Where:
	* `APP-GUID` is the GUID of your app
	* `ROUTE-GUID` is the GUID of the route at which the app serves. 
	*  `PORT1` is the app port, or one of the app ports, that you added in the previous step. 

1. Repeat the previous two steps for each port that you want your app to receive requests on.
