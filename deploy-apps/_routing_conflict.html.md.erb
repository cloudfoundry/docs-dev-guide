<%=vars.product_short%> allows multiple apps, or versions of the same app, to be mapped to the same route. This feature activates blue-green deployment. For more information see [Using blue-green deployment to reduce downtime and risk](./blue-green.html).

Routing multiple apps to the same route might cause undesirable behavior in some situations by routing incoming requests randomly to one of the apps on the shared route.
