title: Configuring SSH access for your deployment
owner: Diego

If you need to troubleshoot an instance of an app, you can gain SSH access to the app using the SSH proxy and daemon.
For example, one of your app instances might be unresponsive, or the log output from the app is inconsistent or incomplete. You can SSH into the individual VM to troubleshoot the problem instance.

<%= vars.mutual_tls_ssh %>


## <a id="diego-ssh-concepts"></a> About SSH access

The SSH system components include the SSH proxy and daemon, and the system also supports authentication and load balancing of incoming SSH traffic. For a conceptual overview, see [App SSH Components and Processes](../../concepts/diego/ssh-conceptual.html).

Operators, space managers, and space developers can configure SSH access for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>,
for spaces, and for apps as described in this table:

<table id='TK-NAME' border="1" class="nice" >
  <tr>
    <th><strong>User Role</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Scope of SSH Permissions Control</strong></th>
    <th><strong>How They Define SSH Permissions</strong></th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>Operator</td>
    <td>Entire deployment</td>
    <td>Configure the deployment to allow or prohibit SSH access (one-time). <%=vars.config_ssh_link%></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>Space Manager</td>
    <td>Space</td>
    <td>cf CLI <code>cf allow-space-ssh</code> and <code>cf disallow-space-ssh</code> commands</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>Space Developer</td>
    <td>App</td>
    <td>cf CLI <code>enable-ssh</code> and <code>disable-ssh</code> commands</td>
  </tr>
</table>

An app is SSH-accessible only if operators, space managers, and space developers all grant SSH access at their respective levels. For example, the image below shows a deployment where:

* An operator allowed SSH access at the deployment level.
* A space manager allowed SSH access for apps running in spaces "A" and "B" but not "C".
* A space developer enabled SSH access for apps that include "Foo", "Bar", and "Baz".

As a result, apps "Foo", "Bar", and "Baz" accept SSH requests.

![This diagram shows examples of successful and unsuccessful SSH Application Access Control in deployments.](../images/ssh-app-access.png)

Space A has SSH Access Enabled, indicated by a green checkmark, for apps "Foo" and "Bar". Space A does not have SSH Access Enabled for the third app, indicated by a red X.

Space B has has SSH Access Enabled, indicated by a green checkmark, for app "Baz". Space B does not have SSH Access Enabled for the other two apps, indicated by a red X.

Space C does not have SSH Access Enabled for all three apps, indicated by a red X.

## <a id='app-ssh-config'></a> SSH access for apps and spaces

Space managers and space developers can configure SSH access from the command line. The Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) also includes commands to return the value of the SSH access setting. To use and configure SSH at both the app level and the space level, see [Accessing Apps with Diego SSH](./ssh-apps.html).
