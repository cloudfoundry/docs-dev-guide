title: Using Blue-Green Deployment to Reduce Downtime and Risk
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

_This page assumes you are using cf CLI v6._

Blue-green deployment is a release technique that reduces downtime and risk by
running two identical production environments called Blue and Green.

At any time, only one of the environments is live, with the live environment
serving all production traffic.
For this example, Blue is currently live and Green is idle.

As you prepare a new release of your software, deployment and the final stage of
testing takes place in the environment that is *not* live: in this example,
Green.
Once you have deployed and fully tested the software in Green, you switch the
router so all incoming requests now go to Green instead of Blue.
Green is now live, and Blue is idle.

This technique can eliminate downtime due to application deployment.
In addition, blue-green deployment reduces risk: if something unexpected happens
with your new release on Green, you can immediately roll back to the last
version by switching back to Blue.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can adjust the route mapping pattern to display a static maintenance page during a maintenance window for time-consuming tasks, such as migrating a database. In this scenario, the router switches all incoming requests from Blue to Maintenance to Green.

## <a id='blue-green-deployment'></a>Blue-Green Deployment with Cloud Foundry Example ##

For this example, we’ll start with a simple application: "demo-time."
This app is a web page that displays the words "Blue time" and the date/time on
the server.

### <a id='push-an-app'></a>Step 1: Push an App ###
Use the cf CLI to push the application.
Name the application "Blue" with the subdomain "demo-time."

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push Blue -n demo-time
</pre>

As shown in the graphic below:

* Blue is now running on Cloud Foundry.
* The CF Router sends all traffic for `demo-time.example.com` traffic to Blue.

### <a id='update-and-push'></a>Step 2: Update App and Push ###

Now make a change to the application.
First, replace the word "Blue" on the web page with "Green," then rebuild the source file for the application.
Run `cf push` again, but use the name "Green" for the application and provide a
different subdomain to create a temporary route:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push Green -n demo-time-temp
</pre>

After this push:

* Two instances of our application are now running on Cloud Foundry: the
original Blue and the updated Green.
* The CF Router still sends all traffic for `demo-time.example.com` traffic to
Blue.
The router now also sends any traffic for `demo-time-temp.example.com` to Green.

### <a id='map-green'></a>Step 3: Map Original Route to Green ###

Now that both apps are up and running, switch the router so all incoming
requests go to the Green app *and* the Blue app.
Do this by mapping the original URL route (`demo-time.example.com`) to the Green
application.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf map-route Green example.com -n demo-time
Binding demo-time.example.com to Green... OK
</pre>

After the `cf map-route` command :

* The CF Router continues to send traffic for `demo-time-temp.example.com` to Green.
* The CF Router immediately begins to load balance traffic for
`demo-time.example.com` between Blue and Green.

### <a id='unmap-blue'></a>Step 4: Unmap Route to Blue ###

Once you verify Green is running as expected, stop routing requests to Blue
using the `cf unmap-route` command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unmap-route Blue example.com -n demo-time
Unbinding demo-time.example.com from blue... OK
</pre>

After `cf unmap-route` command:

* The CF Router stops sending traffic to Blue.
Instead, it routes all traffic to `demo-time.example.com` to Green:

<%= image_tag("../images/blue-green/unmap.png") %>

### <a id='remove-temp-route'></a>Step 5: Remove Temporary Route to Green ###

You can now use `cf unmap-route` to remove the route to `demo-time-temp.example.com`.
You can also decommission Blue, or keep it in case you need to roll back your
changes.
