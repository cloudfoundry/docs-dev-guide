This topic describes how to use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to push an app to <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>.


## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

The cf CLI command `cf push` pushes apps to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.
There are two main ways to run the `cf push` command:

- Run `cf push APP-NAME` to push an app the easiest way, using default settings.
- Run the `cf push` command with flags and helper files to customize:
    - How the pushed app runs, including its route (URL), instance count, and memory limits.
    - How the push process works: whether it's configured with a manifest, runs a startup script, or limits files uploaded to the Cloud Controller.

The [Push with Defaults](#default-push) and [Push with Custom Settings](#custom-push) sections below detail both of these options.

For an explanation of what <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> does when you run `cf push`, see [How Apps are Staged](../../concepts/how-applications-are-staged.html).

For information about the lifecycle of an app, see [App Container Lifecycle](./app-lifecycle.html)

## <a id='prepare'></a> Prerequisites

Before you push your app to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, make sure that:

* Your app is *cloud-ready*.
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> behaviors related to file storage, HTTP sessions, and port usage
may require modifications to your app.
For help preparing your app to be pushed to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, see:
  - [Considerations for Designing and Running an App in the Cloud](./prepare-to-deploy.html)
  - Any [Buildpacks](../../buildpacks/index.html) guides specific to your app language or framework, such as [Getting Started Deploying Ruby on Rails Apps](../../buildpacks/ruby/gsg-ror.html)

* Your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> installation supports the type of app you are going to
push, or you have the URL of an externally-available buildpack that can stage
the app.

* All required app resources are uploaded.
For example, you may need to include a database driver.

* You have your target and credentials:
  - The API endpoint for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> installation. Also known as the target
URL, this is <%=vars.api_endpoint%>.
  - Your username and password for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> installation.

* You are logged into your app's target org and space.
  1. Decide the org and space where you want to push your app.
  You may have access to one or more org and space.
  1. Log into this target org and space with `cf login`.

* Your app can access every service that it uses, because an instance of the service runs in, or is shared with, the app's space.
  - See [Sharing Service Instances](../services/sharing-instances.html) for how to share service instances across spaces.
  - Typical services that cloud apps use include databases, message queues, and key-value stores.

## <a id='default-push'></a>Push with Defaults

To push an app with default settings, do the following:

1. Choose a name for the app.
  - The app name must consist of alphanumeric characters.
  - The app name must be unique to your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> installation.
       - To use an app name that is not unique, customize the app's route as described in [Customize the Route](#custom-route) below.
       -  Apps running at their default routes require unique names because default routes are based on app names, and all routes must be globally unique.

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    cf push APP-NAME
    ```
    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app.


### <a id='default-route'></a> Default Route

An app's route is the URL that it runs at.  <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> assembles the route for a pushed app from a hostname and a domain.

By default, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> sets the hostname and domain as follows:

* **Hostname**: The name of the app, as specified in the `cf push` command.
  - If the app name contains underscores, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> converts them to hyphens when creating the app's route.

* **Domain**: The default apps domain for the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> installation.

For example, an app named `my-app-1234` running on <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> with an apps domain `apps.example.com` would, by default, run at the URL `https://my-app-1234.apps.example.com`.

For more information about routes and domains, see [Routes and Domains](./routes-domains.html).

### <a id='example'></a> Example Session

The following session illustrates  how <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> assigns default values
to app when given a `cf push` command.

## <a id='custom-push'></a>Push with Custom Settings

Pushing an app with with custom settings typically proceeds as follows:

  1. [(Optional) Customize Basic App Settings](#basic-settings)
  1. [(Optional) Customize the Route](#custom-route)
  1. [(Optional) Limit the Upload Files](#exclude)
  1. [(Optional) Configure App Initialization](#profile)
  1. [Custom Push the App](#custom-cf-push)
  1. [(Optional) Configure App Services](#services)

The sections below detail these steps.

### <a id='basic-settings'></a>(Optional) Customize Basic App Settings

Basic settings to customize when pushing an app include:

* **Name**: You can use any series of alphanumeric characters as the name of your app.
* **Instances**: Generally speaking, the more app instances you run, the less
downtime your app will experience.
If your app is still in development, running a single instance can simplify troubleshooting.
For any production app, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends a minimum of two instances.
* **Memory Limit**: The maximum amount of memory that each instance of your
app can consume.
If an instance exceeds this limit, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> restarts the instance.
If an instance exceeds its memory limit repeatedly in a short period of time, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
	delays restarting the instance.
* **Start Command**: This is the command that <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> uses to start each
instance of your app.
This start command differs by app framework.

### <a id='custom-route'></a>(Optional) Customize the Route

To customize an app's route, do the following:

1. **(Optional) Customize the Hostname**
  - Pass the custom hostname into `cf push` with the `-n` flag.

1. **(Optional) Customize the Domain**
  - Pass the custom domain into `cf push` with the `-d` flag.
  The custom domain must be registered, and mapped to the org that contains the app's target space

1. **Ensure Route Uniqueness**
  - The app's route must be globally unique, whether you customize its host or domain, or let it use the [Default Route](#default-route) described above.
  - To help ensure route uniqueness, pass the `--random-route` option into `cf push`.
`--random-route` creates a route that includes the app name and random words

### <a id='exclude'></a>(Optional) Limit the Upload Files

By default, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> uploads all app files except version control files and
folders with names such as `.svn`, `.git`, and `_darcs`.

<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you explicitly exclude extraneous files residing within your app directory, particularly if your app is large.
For example, if you build your app locally and push it as a binary, you can save resources by not uploading any of the app's source code.

To exclude files from upload:

1. Create a `.cfignore` file that lists the files to exclude.

1. Save the `.cfignore` file to the directory where you run the `cf push` command.

For more information, see the [Ignore Unnecessary Files When Pushing](./prepare-to-deploy.html#exclude) section of the [Considerations for Designing and Running an App in the Cloud](./prepare-to-deploy.html) topic.

### <a id='profile'></a>(Optional) Configure App Initialization

You can configure `cf push` to run custom initialization tasks for an app.

These tasks run after <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> loads the app droplet but before it launches the app itself to let the initialization script access the app language runtime environment. For example, your script can map values from `$VCAP_SERVICES` into other environment variables or a config file that the app uses.

<div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: See below for important information about configuring app initialization when you use certain buildpacks:
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Java:</strong> Initialization scripts for the Java buildpack require additional configuration.
      For more information, see <a href="https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/how-to-modify-the-application-container-environment-prior-to-application-execution?language=en_US">How to Modify the Application Container Environment prior to Application Execution</a> in the Knowledge Base.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>PHP:</strong> <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> does not support initialization scripts for the PHP buildpack versions prior to v4.3.18. If you use one of these buildpack versions, your app hosts the <code>.profile</code> script's contents. This means that any app staged using the affected buildpack versions can leak credentials placed in the <code>.profile</code> script.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
</div>

To run initialization tasks:

1. Create a `.profile` script that contains the initialization tasks.

1. Save the `.profile` script to the directory where you run the `cf push` command.

As an example, the following `.profile` file uses `bash` to set a value for the environment variable `LANG`. Setting this value at the operating system level lets the app determine which language to use for error messages and instructions, collating sequences, and date formats:

~~~bash
# Set the default LANG for your apps
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
~~~

Your app root directory may also include a `.profile.d` directory that contains bash scripts that perform initialization tasks for the buildpack.
Developers should not edit these scripts unless they are using a [custom buildpack](../../buildpacks/custom.html).

Initialization tasks as described here are also called "pre-runtime hooks" and "`.profile` tasks".

### <a id='custom-cf-push'></a> Custom Push the App

To specify custom options when pushing an app with `cf push`, you can:

* Include them in the `cf push APP-NAME` command itself.
* Include them in a manifest file.
  - The manifest file must be named `manifest.yml` and reside in the directory where you run `cf push`.
  - The manifest can include the app name, which lets you run `cf push` with no arguments.
  - The manifest can also include a [Services](./manifest-attributes.html#services-block) block that lists service instances for the app to bind to automatically.
* Both of the above, command-line options and a manifest.

See [Deploying with App Manifests](./manifest.html) to learn how app settings change from push to push, and how command-line options, manifests, and commands like `cf scale` interact.

See the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/push.html) for a full list of `cf push` options.

### <a id='services'></a>(Optional) Configure App Services

If a newly-pushed app has the same name and route as an older app version, the new app retains the service bindings and service configuration of the previously-pushed version.

For apps that are not already set up for the services that they use, you need to:

1. Bind the services to the app. For more information about services, see the [Services Overview](../services/index.html) topic.

1. (Optional) Configure the app with the service URL and credentials, if needed. For more information, see the specific documentation for your app framework, such as:
  - [Ruby](../../buildpacks/ruby/ruby-service-bindings.html)
  - [Node.js](../../buildpacks/node/node-service-bindings.html)
  - [Spring](../../buildpacks/java/configuring-service-connections/spring-service-bindings.html)
  - [Grails](../../buildpacks/java/configuring-service-connections/grails-service-bindings.html)

## <a id='updates'></a> App Updates and Downtime

When you push an app that is already running, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> stops all existing instances of that app. Users who try to access the app get a "404 Not Found" message while `cf push` runs.

With some app updates, old and new versions of your code should never run at the same time. A worst-case example is if your app update migrates a database schema, causing old app instances to fail and lose user data.  To prevent this, you need to stop all running instances of your app before you push the new version.

When old and new versions of your app can run simultaneously, you can avoid app downtime by using the [blue-green method](./blue-green.html) to swap routes between app versions running in parallel.


## <a id='troubleshoot-push'></a>Troubleshoot App Push Problems

If your app does not start on <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, first ensure that the app can run locally.

For how to troubleshoot your app in the cloud using the cf CLI, see [Troubleshoot App Deployment and Health](./troubleshoot-app-health.html).
