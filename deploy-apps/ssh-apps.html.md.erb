title: Accessing your apps with SSH
owner: Diego
---


The Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) lets you securely log into remote host virtual machines (VMs) running <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) app instances. The commands that enable SSH access to apps, and enable, deactivate, and check permissions for such access are described here.

<p class="note important">
The <code>cf ssh</code> command in cf CLI v7+ includes the <code>all_proxy</code> environment variable, which allows you to specify a proxy server to activate proxying for all requests. For more information, see <a href="../../cf-cli/http-proxy.html#v3-ssh-socks5">Use SOCKS5 with cf v3-ssh</a> in <em>Using the cf CLI with a proxy server</em>.
For command details, enter <code>cf ssh --help</code></p>

The cf CLI looks up the `app_ssh_oauth_client` identifier in the Cloud Controller `/v2/info` endpoint, and uses this identifier to query the UAA server for an SSH authorization code. On the target VM side, the SSH proxy contacts the Cloud Controller through the `app_ssh_endpoint` listed in `/v2/info` to confirm permission for SSH access.

## <a id="enable-disable-ssh"></a> Enable and Disable SSH Access

A cloud operator can deploy <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to either allow or prohibit app SSH across the entire deployment. <%= vars.config_ssh_link %>

Within a deployment that permits SSH access to apps, Space Developers can enable or disable SSH access to individual apps, and Space Managers can enable or disable SSH access to all apps running within a space.

You must restart your app after enabling SSH access.

### <a id="configure-ssh-access-apps"></a> Configuring SSH Access at the App Level

`cf enable-ssh` activates SSH access to all instances of an app:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf enable-ssh MY-AWESOME-APP
</pre>

`cf disable-ssh` deactivates SSH access to all instances of an app:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf disable-ssh MY-AWESOME-APP
</pre>

### <a id="configure-ssh-access-spaces"></a> Configuring SSH Access at the Space Level

`cf allow-space-ssh` allows SSH access into all apps in a space:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf allow-space-ssh SPACE-NAME
</pre>

`cf disallow-space-ssh` disallows SSH access into all apps in a space:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf disallow-space-ssh SPACE-NAME
</pre>


## <a id="check-ssh-permissions"></a> Check SSH Permissions

`cf ssh-enabled` verifies whether an app is accessible with SSH:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf ssh-enabled MY-AWESOME-APP
ssh support is disabled for 'MY-AWESOME-APP'
</pre>

`cf space-ssh-allowed` verifies whether all apps running within a space are accessible with SSH:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf space-ssh-allowed SPACE-NAME
ssh support is enabled in space 'SPACE-NAME'
</pre>


## <a id="ssh-command"></a> Log Into an App Container with cf SSH

If SSH access is allowed at the deployment, space, and app level, you can run the `cf ssh APP-NAME` command to start an interactive SSH session with a VM hosting an app. By default, the command accesses the container running the first instance of the app, the instance with index **0**.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf ssh MY-AWESOME-APP
</pre>

<%= vars.cfdot_kb %>

### <a id="ssh-common-flags"></a> Common cf SSH Flags

You can tailor `cf ssh` commands with the following flags, most of which mimic flags for the UNIX or Linux `ssh` command. Run the `cf ssh --help` command for more details.

* The `-i` flag targets a specific instance of an app. To log into the VM container hosting the third instance, `index=2`,  of MY-AWESOME-APP, run:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf ssh MY-AWESOME-APP -i 2
    </pre>

* The `-L` flag enables local port forwarding, binding an output port on your machine to an input port on the app VM. Pass in a local port, and your app VM port and port number, all colon delimited. You can prepend your local network interface, or use the default `localhost`.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf ssh MY-AWESOME-APP -L [LOCAL-NETWORK-INTERFACE:]LOCAL-PORT:REMOTE-HOST-NAME:REMOTE-HOST-PORT
    </pre>

* The `-N` flag skips returning a command prompt on the remote machine. This sets up local port forwarding if you do not need to execute commands on the host VM.

* The `--process` flag in cf CLI v7 allows you to SSH into the container for a specific process running as part of your app.

* The `--request-pseudo-tty` and `--force-pseudo-tty ` flags let you run an SSH session in pseudo-tty mode rather than generate terminal line output.


## <a id="ssh-env"></a> SSH Session Environment

If you want the environment of your interactive SSH session to match the environment of
your buildpack-based app, with the same environment variables and working directory, run
the following commands after starting the session:

<pre class="terminal">
/tmp/lifecycle/shell
</pre>

After running the above command, the value of the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable differs
slightly from its value in the environment of the app process, as it does not have the `host`,
`instance_id`, `instance_index`, or `port` fields set. These fields are available in other
environment variables, as described in
[VCAP_APPLICATION](environment-variable.html#VCAP-APPLICATION) in
_<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Environment Variables_.


## <a id="other-ssh-access"></a> App SSH Access without cf CLI

In addition to `cf ssh`, you can use other SSH clients such as `ssh`, `scp`, or `sftp` to access
your app, if you have SSH permissions.

Follow one of the processes below to securely connect to an app instance by logging in with a
specially-formed username that passes information to the SSH proxy running on the host VM. For the
password, use a one-time SSH authorization code generated by
[cf ssh-code](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/ssh-code.html).

* [Access App SSH Using Process GUID](#process-guid)
* [Access App SSH Using App GUID](#app-guid)

### <a id="process-guid"></a> Access App SSH Using Process GUID

1. Query the `/v2/info` endpoint of the Cloud Controller in your deployment. Record the domain name
and port number of the `app_ssh_endpoint` field, and the `app_ssh_host_key_fingerprint` field. You
will compare the `app_ssh_host_key_fingerprint` with the fingerprint returned by the SSH proxy on
your target VM. For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf curl /v2/info
    {
         ...
         "app_ssh_endpoint": "ssh.example.com:2222",
         "app_ssh_host_key_fingerprint": "a6:14:c0:ea:42:07:b2:f7:53:2c:0b:60:e0:00:21:6c",
         ...
    }
    </pre>

    In this example:
    <ul>
      <li>The domain name is <code>ssh.example.com</code>.</li>
      <li>The port number is <code>2222</code>.</li>
      <li>The fingerprint is <code>a6:14:c0:ea:42:07:b2:f7:53:2c:0b:60:e0:00:21:6c</code>.</li>
    </ul>

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    ssh -p PORT-NUMBER cf:$(cf curl /v3/apps/$(cf app APP-NAME --guid)/processes | jq -r '.resources[] | select(.type=="web") | .guid')/0@SSH-ENDPOINT
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>PORT-NUMBER</code> is the port number of the <code>app_ssh_endpoint</code> field that you recorded in the previous step.</li>
      <li><code>APP-NAME</code> is the name of your target app.</li>
      <li><code>SSH-ENDPOINT</code> is the domain name of the <code>app_ssh_endpoint</code> field that you recorded in theprevious step.</li>
    </ul>

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    ssh -p 2222 cf:$(cf curl /v3/apps/$(cf app my-app --guid)/processes | jq -r '.resources[] | select(.type=="web") | .guid')/0&#64;ssh.example.com
    </pre>

1. Run `cf ssh-code` to obtain a one-time authorization code that substitutes for an SSH password.
You can run `cf ssh-code | pbcopy` to automatically copy the code to the clipboard. For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf ssh-code
    E1x89n
    </pre>

1. When the SSH proxy reports its RSA fingerprint, confirm that it matches the
`app_ssh_host_key_fingerprint` recorded above. When prompted for a password, paste in the
authorization code returned by `cf ssh-code`. For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ ssh -p 2222 cf:abcdefab-1234-5678-abcd-1234abcd1234/0<span>@</span>ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com
    The authenticity of host '[ssh.example.com]:2222 ([203.0.113.5]:2222)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is a6:14:c0:ea:42:07:b2:f7:53:2c:0b:60:e0:00:21:6c.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added '[ssh.example.com]:2222 [203.0.113.5]:2222' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    cf:d0a2e11d-e6ca-4120-b32d-140<span>@</span>ssh.ketchup.cf-app.com's password:
    vcap@ce4l5164kws:~$
    </pre>

    You have now securely connected to the app instance.

### <a id="app-guid"></a> Access App SSH Using App GUID

1. Display the GUID of your target app by running:

    ```console
    cf app APP-NAME --guid`
    ```
    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf app my-app --guid
    abcdefab-1234-5678-abcd-1234abcd1234
    </pre>

1. Query the `/v2/info` endpoint of the Cloud Controller in your deployment. Record the domain name
and port number of the `app_ssh_endpoint` field, and the `app_ssh_host_key_fingerprint` field. You will compare the `app_ssh_host_key_fingerprint` with the fingerprint returned by the SSH proxy on your target VM. For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf curl /v2/info
    {
         ...
         "app_ssh_endpoint": "ssh.example.com:2222",
         "app_ssh_host_key_fingerprint": "a6:14:c0:ea:42:07:b2:f7:53:2c:0b:60:e0:00:21:6c",
         ...
    }
    </pre>

    In this example:
    <ul>
      <li>The domain name is <code>ssh.example.com</code>.</li>
      <li>The port number is <code>2222</code>.</li>
      <li>The fingerprint is <code>a6:14:c0:ea:42:07:b2:f7:53:2c:0b:60:e0:00:21:6c</code>.</li>
    </ul>


1. Run `cf ssh-code` to obtain a one-time authorization code that substitutes for an SSH password. You can run `cf ssh-code | pbcopy` to automatically copy the code to the clipboard. For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf ssh-code
    E1x89n
    </pre>

1. Run your `ssh` or other command to connect to the app instance.
    - SSH into the container hosting the first instance of your app by running the following command.
    For the username, use a string of the form `cf:APP-GUID/APP-INSTANCE-INDEX@SSH-ENDPOINT`:

        ```console
        ssh -p `SSH-PORT` cf:APP-GUID/APP-INSTANCE-INDEX@SSH-ENDPOINT
        ```

        Where:
        <ul>
          <li><code>SSH-PORT</code> is the port number recorded in earlier steps.</li>
          <li><code>APP-GUID</code> comes from the previous steps.</li>
          <li><code>APP-INSTANCE-INDEX</code> is the index of the instance that you want to access.</li>
          <li><code>SSH-ENDPOINT</code> comes from the previous steps and is in the form <code>ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">
        $ ssh -p 2222 cf:abcdefab-1234-5678-abcd-1234abcd1234/0<span>@</span>ssh.example.com
        </pre>
    - Or you can use `scp` to transfer files by running one of the following commands:

        ```console
        scp -P `SSH-PORT` -o User=cf:APP-GUID/APP-INSTANCE-INDEX ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com:REMOTE-FILE-TO-RETRIEVE LOCAL-FILE-DESTINATION
        ```
        ```console
        scp -P `SSH-PORT` -o User=cf:APP-GUID/APP-INSTANCE-INDEX LOCAL-FILE-TO-COPY ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com:REMOTE-FILE-DESTINATION
        ```
    - Or you can use `ssh` piped with `cat` command to transfer file by running:

        ```console
        cat local_file_path | cf ssh MY-AWESOME-APP -c "cat > remote_file_path"
        ```

1. When the SSH proxy reports its RSA fingerprint, confirm that it matches the `app_ssh_host_key_fingerprint` recorded above. When prompted for a password, paste in the authorization code returned by `cf ssh-code`, for example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ ssh -p 2222 cf:abcdefab-1234-5678-abcd-1234abcd1234/0<span>@</span>ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com
    The authenticity of host '[ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com]:2222 ([203.0.113.5]:2222)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is a6:14:c0:ea:42:07:b2:f7:53:2c:0b:60:e0:00:21:6c.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added '[ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com]:2222 [203.0.113.5]:2222' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    cf:d0a2e11d-e6ca-4120-b32d-140<span>@</span>ssh.ketchup.cf-app.com's password:
    vcap@ce4l5164kws:~$
    </pre>

You have now securely connected to the app instance.

## <a id="ssh-proxy-security-configuration"></a> SSH Proxy Security Configuration

The SSH proxy has the following SSH security configuration by default:

<table id='ssh-proxy-security-configuration-values' border="1" class="nice">
  <tr>
    <th>Security Parameter</th>
    <th>Values</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ciphers</td>
    <td>
      <code>chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</code><br/>
      <code>aes128-gcm@openssh.com</code><br/>
      <code>aes256-ctr</code><br/>
      <code>aes192-ctr</code><br/>
      <code>aes128-ctr</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><abbr title="Message Authentication Codes">MACs</abbr></td>
    <td>
      <code>hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com</code><br/>
      <code>hmac-sha2-256</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Key Exchanges</td>
    <td>
      <code>curve25519-sha256@libssh.org</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The `cf ssh` command is compatible with this security configuration. If you use a different SSH client to access apps over SSH, you should ensure that you configure your client to be compatible with these ciphers, MACs, and key exchanges. For more information about other SSH clients, see [App SSH Access without cf CLI](#other-ssh-access) above.

<% if vars.platform_code == 'CF' %>
Cloud Foundry deployment operators can also change these default values in the SSH proxy configuration. Changing these default values may require a change to the SSH client configuration.
<% end %>


## <a id="proxy-to-container-auth"></a> Proxy to Container Authentication

A second layer of SSH security runs within each container. When the SSH proxy attempts to handshake with the SSH daemon inside the target container, it uses the following fields associated with the `diego-ssh` key in its route to the app instance. This inner layer works invisibly and requires no user action, but is described here to complete the SSH security picture.

### CONTAINER_PORT (required)

`container_port` indicates which port inside the container the SSH daemon is listening on. The proxy attempts to connect to host side mapping of this port after authenticating the client.

### HOST_FINGERPRINT (optional)

When present, `host_fingerprint` declares the expected fingerprint of the SSH daemon's host public key. When the fingerprint of the actual target's host key does not match the expected fingerprint, the connection is terminated. The fingerprint should only contain the hex string generated by `ssh-keygen -l`.

### USER (optional)

`user` declares the user ID to use during authentication with the container's SSH daemon. While this is not a required part of the routing data, it is required for password authentication and may be required for public key authentication.

### PASSWORD (optional)

`password` declares the password to use during password authentication with the container's ssh daemon.

### PRIVATE_KEY (optional)

`private_key` declares the private key to use when authenticating with the container's SSH daemon. If present, the key must be a PEM encoded RSA or DSA public key.

#### Example App Process

      "container_port": 2222,
      "private_key": "PEM encoded PKCS#1 private key"
    }
  }
}
```

### Daemon Discovery

To be accessible through the SSH proxy, containers must host an SSH daemon, expose it through a mapped port, and advertise the port in a `diego-ssh` route. If a proxy cannot find the target process or a route, user authentication fails.

```
  "routes": {
    "diego-ssh": { "container_port": 2222 }
  }
```

The Diego system generates the appropriate process definitions for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> apps which reflect the policies that are in effect.
