<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Loggregator, the Cloud Foundry component responsible for logging, provides a
stream of log output from your app and from Cloud Foundry system
components that interact with your app during updates and execution.

By default, Loggregator streams logs to your terminal.
If you want to persist more than the limited amount of logging information that
Loggregator can buffer, you can drain logs to a third-party log management
service.
See [Third-Party Log Management Services](../services/log-management.html).

Cloud Foundry gathers and stores logs in a best-effort manner.
If a client is unable to consume log lines quickly enough, the Loggregator
buffer may need to overwrite some lines before the client has consumed them.
A syslog drain or a CLI tail can usually keep up with the flow of app
logs.

## <a id='types'></a>Contents of a Log Line ##

Every log line contains four fields:

1. Timestamp
1. Log type (origin code)
1. Channel: either `OUT` (logs emitted on `stdout`) or `ERR` (logs emitted on `stderr`)
1. Message

Loggregator assigns the timestamp when it receives log data.
The log data is opaque to Loggregator, which simply puts it in the message field
of the log line.
Apps or system components sending log data to Loggregator may include
their own timestamps, which then appear in the message field.

Origin codes distinguish the different log types.
Origin codes from system components have three letters.
The app origin code is `APP` followed by slash and a digit that
indicates the app instance.

Many frameworks write to an app log that is separate from STDOUT and
STDERR.
This is not supported by Loggregator.
Your app must write to STDOUT or STDERR for its logs to be included in
the Loggregator stream.
Check the buildpack your app uses to determine whether it automatically
ensures that your app correctly writes logs to STDOUT and STDERR only.
Some buildpacks do this, and some do not.

## <a id='format'></a>Log Types and Their Messages ##

Different types of logs have different message formats, as shown in the examples
below.
The digit appended to the code indicates the instance index: 0 is the first instance, 1 is the second, and so on.

### <a id='api'></a>API ###

Users make API calls to request changes in app state. Cloud Controller,
the Cloud Foundry component responsible for the API, logs the actions that Cloud
Controller takes in response.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
2016-06-14T14:10:05.36-0700 [API/0]      OUT Updated app with guid cdabc600-0b73-48e1-b7d2-26af2c63f933 ({"name"=>"spring-music", "instances"=>1, "memory"=>512, "environment_json"=>"PRIVATE DATA HIDDEN"})
</pre>

### <a id='stg'></a>STG ###

The Diego cell or the Droplet Execution Agent emits STG logs when staging or restaging an app.
These actions implement the desired state requested by the user.
After the droplet has been uploaded, STG messages end and CELL messages begin.
For STG, the instance index is almost always 0.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
2016-06-14T14:10:27.91-0700 [STG/0]      OUT Staging...
</pre>

### <a id='rtr'></a>RTR ###

The Router emits RTR logs when it routes HTTP requests to the app.
Router messages include the app name followed by a Router timestamp and
then selections from the HTTP request.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
2016-06-14T10:51:32.51-0700 [RTR/1]      OUT www.example.com - [14/06/2016:17:51:32.459 +0000] "GET /user/ HTTP/1.1" 200 0 103455 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.123 Safari/537.30" 192.0.2.132:46359 x_forwarded_for:"198.51.100.120" x_forwarded_proto:"http" vcap_request_id:9365d216-623a-45cb-6ef6-eba495c19fa8 response_time:0.059468637 app_id:79cc58aa-3737-43ae-ac71-39a2843b5178
</pre>

#### <a id="traceid"></a> Zipkin Trace Logging

If Zipkin trace logging is enabled in Cloud Foundry, then Gorouter access log messages contain Zipkin HTTP headers. 

The following is an example access log message containing Zipkin headers:

<pre class="terminal">
2016-11-23T16:04:01.49-0800 [RTR/0]      OUT www.example.com - [24/11/2016:00:04:01.227 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 0 109 "-" "curl/7.43.0" 10.0.2.150:4070 10.0.48.66:60815 x_forwarded_for:"198.51.100.120" x_forwarded_proto:"http" vcap_request_id:87f9d899-c7a4-46cd-7b76-4ec35ce9921b response_time:0.263000966 app_id:8e5d6451-b369-4423-bce8-3a7a9e479dbb app_index:0 x_b3_traceid:"2d5610bf5e0f7241" x_b3_spanid:"2d5610bf5e0f7241" x_b3_parentspanid:"-"
</pre>

For more information about Zipkin tracing, see the [Zipkin Tracking in HTTP Headers](../../concepts/http-routing.html#zipkin-headers) topic.

### <a id='lgr'></a>LGR ###

Loggregator emits LGR to indicate problems with the logging process.
Examples include "can't reach syslog drain url" and "dropped log messages due to high rate."

### <a id='app'></a>APP ###

Every app emits logs according to choices by the developer.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
2016-06-14T14:10:15.18-0700 [APP/0]      OUT Exit status 0
</pre>

### <a id="ssh"></a>SSH ###

The Diego cell emits SSH logs when a user accesses an application container through SSH by using the [cf ssh](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/ssh.html) command.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
2016-06-14T14:16:11.49-0700 [SSH/0]      OUT Successful remote access by 192.0.2.33:7856
</pre>

### <a id='cell'></a>CELL ###

The Diego cell emits CELL logs when it starts or stops the
app. These actions implement the desired state requested by the user.
The Diego cell also emits messages when an app crashes.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
2016-06-14T13:44:38.14-0700 [CELL/0]     OUT Successfully created container
</pre>

## <a id='writing'></a>Writing to the Log from Your App ##

Your app must write logs to `stderr` or `stdout`.
Both are typically buffered, and you should flush the buffer before delivering
the message to Loggregator.

Alternatively, you can write log messages to `stderr` or `stdout` synchronously.
This approach is mainly used for debugging because it may affect app
performance.

## <a id='container-metrics'></a> Including Container Metrics in Syslog Drains

By default, app logs are included in syslog drains. To include container metrics in your syslog drain, an operator must first set the `scalablesyslog.adapter.metrics_to_syslog_enabled` to `true`. Then you can include the `-metrics` option in the `cf create-drain` command, as shown below.

<pre class=‘term’>$ cf create-drain -metrics YOUR_APP_INSTANCE YOUR_SYSLOG_DRAIN SYSLOG_DRAIN_URL</pre>

## <a id='view'></a>Viewing Logs in the Command Line Interface ##

You view logs in the CLI using the [cf logs](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/logs.html) command.
You can tail, dump, or filter log output.

### <a id="tail-log"></a>Tailing Logs ###

`cf logs APP_NAME` streams Loggregator output to the terminal.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf logs spring-music
Connected, tailing logs for app spring-music in org example / space development as admin@example.com...

2016-06-14T15:16:12.70-0700 [RTR/4]      OUT www.example.com - [14/06/2016:22:16:12.582 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 0 103455 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/50.0.2661.102 Safari/537.36" 192.0.2.206:27743 x_forwarded_for:"203.0.113.222" x_forwarded_proto:"http" vcap_request_id:bd3e6ed1-5dd0-43ab-70ed-5d232b577b09 response_time:0.12050583 app_id:79bb58ab-3737-43be-ac70-39a2843b5177

    ...
</pre>

Use **Ctrl-C** (^C) to exit the real-time stream.

### <a id="dump-log"></a>Dumping Logs ###

`cf logs APP_NAME --recent` displays all the lines in the Loggregator buffer.

### <a id="filter"></a>Filtering Logs ###

To view some subset of log output, use `cf logs` in conjunction with filtering
commands of your choice.
In the example below, `grep -v` excludes all Router logs:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf logs spring-music --recent | grep -v RTR
2016-06-14T14:10:05.36-0700 [API/0]      OUT Updated app with guid cdabc604-0b73-47e1-a7d5-24af2c63f723 ({"name"=>"spring-music", "instances"=>1, "memory"=>512, "environment_json"=>"PRIVATE DATA HIDDEN"})
2016-06-14T14:10:14.52-0700 [APP/0]      OUT - Gracefully stopping, waiting for requests to finish
2016-06-14T14:10:14.52-0700 [CELL/0]     OUT Exit status 0

2016-06-14T14:10:14.56-0700 [CELL/0]     OUT Creating container
    ...
</pre>

### <a id=‘log-ordering’></a> Log Ordering

Ensuring log ordering in drains can be an important for both operators and developers. However, the Loggregator Firehose does not offer a deterministic routing mechanism for ordering.  

For operators configuring syslog drains, it is useful to note that:

* Diego uses a nanosecond-based timestamp that can be ingested properly by Splunk. For more information, see [these instructions](https://answers.splunk.com/answers/1946/time-format-and-subseconds.html).
* The Elastic Stack can ingest the nanosecond timestamps but only supports millisecond precision, so timestamps are truncated. For more information, see [ELK's date type](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/date.html) and the relevant [issue](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10005).

If you are developing a client that displays a stream of Cloud Foundry logs to users, consider ordering the logs to improve the debugging experience for your user. The following are general tips for ordering logs:

* Batch the logs and display whatever logs you have in that timeframe sorted by timestamp. This technique is good for CLIs. 
* For web clients you can use dynamic HTML to insert older logs into the sorting as they appear. This is nice because by the time a user grabs the content for a copy paste, the logs will likely be both complete and in order. 
* Java app developers may want to convert stack traces into a single log entity. For more information, see [Multi-Line Stack Traces as a Single Log Entity](#multi-line-stack-traces).

#### <a id=‘multi-line-stack-traces’></a> Multi-Line Stack Traces as a Single Log Entity

To simplify log ordering for Java apps, use the [multi-line Java message workaround](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-release/blob/develop/docs/java-multi-line-work-around.md) to convert your multi-line stack traces into a single log entity. 

By modifying the Java log output, you can make your app reformat your stack trace messages so any newline characters are replaced with a token. Then, you can make your log parsing code replace that token with newline characters again to display the logs properly in Kibana.
