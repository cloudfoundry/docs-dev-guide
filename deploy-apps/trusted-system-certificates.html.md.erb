title: Trusted System Certificates
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

A Cloud Foundry Administrator can deploy a set of trusted system certificates. These trusted certificates are available in Linux-based app instances running on the Diego backend. Such instances include buildpack-based apps using the `cflinuxfs3` stack and Docker-image-based apps. 

If the administrator configures these certificates, they are available inside the instance containers as files with extension `.crt` in the read-only `/etc/cf-system-certificates` directory. 

For `cflinuxfs3`-based apps, these certificates are also installed directly in the `/etc/ssl/certs` directory, and are available automatically to libraries such as `openssl` that respect that trust store. If the administrator configure these certificates, the location of the certificates is provided in the environment variable `CF_SYSTEM_CERT_PATH` on the instance container.
