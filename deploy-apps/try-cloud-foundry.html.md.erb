Interested in trying Cloud Foundry without setting up an environment yourself?

Several Cloud Foundry providers offer publicly accessible platforms where you can deploy and manage apps using the `cf` CLI â€” without installing Cloud Foundry on your own infrastructure.

ðŸ‘‰ **Visit the [Try Cloud Foundry page on cloudfoundry.org](https://cloudfoundry.org/try-cloud-foundry)** for a curated list of providers and instructions on how to get started.

This page is continuously updated by the Cloud Foundry community. If you offer a public Cloud Foundry platform and would like to be listed, feel free to contribute through the Cloud Foundry Slack or open an issue in the [CF community GitHub repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/issues).
