<%= vars.gsg_app_video_link %>


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Developing, running, and managing apps on <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> might include:

* Deploying and scaling apps with diverse languages, frameworks, and dependencies
* Finding software services in the services Marketplace, such as databases, email, or message servers
* Creating your own <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> service based on an external server
* Creating service instances and binding them to your apps
* Streaming app logs to an external log management service
* Troubleshooting app deployment and health

If you do these things, you are a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>Â **developer**, and the contents of this guide are for you.
