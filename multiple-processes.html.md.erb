title: Pushing an app with multiple processes
owner: CAPI
---


The Cloud Foundry API (CAPI) V3 supports using a single command to push apps that run multiple processes, such as a web app that has a UI process and a worker
process. You can push an app with multiple processes using either a manifest or a Procfile.

For more information about processes, see [Processes](http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/index.html#processes) in the CAPI V3 documentation.


## <a id='manifest'></a> Push an app with multiple processes using a manifest

To push an app with multiple processes using a manifest:

1. Create a file that defines a manifest. Include each process with its start command. See the following example, which defines the app `example-app` with two processes:

    ```yaml
    version: 1
    - name: example-app
      processes:
      - type: web
        command: bundle exec rackup config.ru -p $PORT
        instances: 3
      - type: worker
        command: bundle exec rake worker:start
        health-check-type: process
        instances: 2
    ```

1. Push the app using your manifest:

    ```console
    cf push -f example-manifest.yml
    ```

For more information about defining processes with manifests, see [processes](deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html#processes") in _App Manifest Attribute Reference_.


## <a id='procfile'></a>Push an app with multiple processes using a Procfile

To push an app with multiple processes using a Procfile:

<p class="note">
<span class="note__title">Note</span>Procfile support varies depending on the buildpack you use. For example, the Staticfile buildpack requires a Staticfile instead of a Procfile. For more information, see <a href="../buildpacks/staticfile/index.html">Staticfile Buildpack</a>.</p>

1. Create a file named `Procfile` in the root of your app directory.

    <p class="note">
    <span class="note__title">Note</span>
    For more information about Procfiles, see the
    <a href="https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/index.html#procfiles">CAPI V3 documentation</a>.</p>

2. Add each process and its start command to the Procfile. For example:

    ```
    web: bundle exec rackup config.ru -p $PORT
    worker: bundle exec rake worker:start
    ```

1. Push the app:

    ```
    cf push myapp
    ```

By default, the web process has a route and one instance. Other processes have zero instances by default.


## <a id='scale-a-process'></a> Scale a process

To scale an app process:

* **cf CLI v7:**

1. Run:

    ```
    cf scale APP-NAME --process PROCESS-NAME -i INSTANCE-COUNT
    ```

    Where
    <ul>
      <li><code>APP-NAME</code> is the name of your app.</li>
      <li><code>PROCESS-NAME</code> is the name of the process you want to scale.</li>
      <li><code>INSTANCE-COUNT</code> is the number of instances to which you want to scale the process.</li>
    </ul>

## <a id='view-processes'></a> View processes

To view the processes running as part of an app:

1. Run:

	```
	cf v3-scale APP-NAME --process PROCESS-NAME -i INSTANCE-COUNT
	```
	Where:
	* `APP-NAME` is the name of your app.
	* `PROCESS-NAME` is the name of the process you want to scale.
	* `INSTANCE-COUNT` is the number of instances to which you want to scale the process.

    <span class="note__title">Important</span>
    This command is experimental and unsupported. Consider upgrading to cf CLI v7 to use a supported version of this command. To upgrade to cf CLI v7, see <a href="../cf-cli/v7.html#install">Install cf CLI v7</a> in <em>Upgrading to cf CLI v7</em>.</p>


## <a id="view-processes"></a> View Processes

To view the processes running as part of an app, run `cf APP-NAME`, where `APP-NAME` is the name of your app. See the following example in which the app has a `web` and a `worker` process.

  To avoid security exposure, ensure that you migrated your apps and custom buildpacks to use the <code>cflinuxfs4</code> stack based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish). The <code>cflinuxfs3</code> stack is based on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver), which reaches end of standard support in April 2023. </p>
