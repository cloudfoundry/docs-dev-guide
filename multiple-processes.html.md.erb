This topic describes how to push and manage apps with multiple processes. 

## <a id="about-processes"></a> About Processes 

The CAPI v3 API supports using a single command to push apps that run multiple processes, such as a web app that has a UI process and a worker process. To push an app that creates multiple processes from the same codebase, you first define its processes in a Procfile. See [Push an App with Multiple Processes](#push-with-multiple-processes). 

For more information about processes, see the <a href="http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/index.html#processes">Processes</a> section of the CAPI v3 documentation. 

## <a id="push-with-multiple-processes"></a> Push an App with Multiple Processes

You can push an app with multiple processes using a Procfile.
Follow the procedure below. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also push an app with multiple processes using an app manifest. See the processes section in <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html#-processes">App Manifest Attribute Reference</a>.</p>


1. Create a file named `Procfile` in the root of your app directory. 
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong> For more information about Procfiles, see the <a href="https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/index.html#procfiles">Procfiles</a> section of the CAPI v3 documentation.</p>
1. Add each process and its start command to the Procfile. See the following example:

	```
	web: bundle exec rackup config.ru -p $PORT
 	worker: bundle exec rake worker:start
 	```
1. Push the app:
	* **cf CLI v7**:

		```
		cf7 push myapp
		```
	* **cf CLI v6**:

		```
		cf6 v3-push myapp
		```

By default, the web process has a route and one instance. Other processes have zero instances by default. 

## <a id="scale-a-process"></a>Scale a Process 

To scale an app process, run the following command:

* **cf CLI v7**:

	```
	cf7 scale APP-NAME --process PROCESS-NAME -i INSTANCE-COUNT
	```
* **cf CLI v6**:

	```
	cf6 v3-scale APP-NAME --process PROCESS-NAME -i INSTANCE-COUNT
	```

## <a id="view-processes"></a>View Processes

To view the processes running as part of an app, run `cf APP-NAME`. See the following example in which the app has a `web` and a `worker` process.

```
$ cf app myapp
