This topic describes how <%= vars.product_name %> app developers can read and write to a mounted file system from their apps. In <%= vars.product_name %>, a volume service provides a volume so your app can read or write to a reliable, persistent file system.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> NFS and SMB volume services are available for Linux cells only. These services are not available for Windows cells.</p>


## <a id="pre"></a> Prerequisite

Before you can use a volume service with your app, determine if any volume services are available for your app. 

To determine if volume services are available:

1. Log in to the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). Run:

    ```
    cf login
    ```

1. List available NFS volume services. Run:  

    ```
    cf marketplace
    ```

    See the following example output of the NFS volume service:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf marketplace
    service   plans      description
    nfs       Existing   Service for connecting to NFS volumes
    </pre>

1. Do one of the following:
    * **If no NFS volume service exists**: If no volume service that fits your requirements exists, contact your <%= vars.admin %>. <%= vars.add_volumes_link %>
    * **If a NFS volume service exists**: Continue to [Mount an External File System](#mount-external-filesystem).




## <a id="mount-external-filesystem"></a> Mount an External Filesystem

The sections below describe how to mount an external filesystem to your app.

### <a id="create"></a> Create and Bind a Service Instance

To use a volume service deployed by your <%= vars.admin %>, you must first create an instance of the specific volume service that you need.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For NFS-specific instructions and information, see <a href="#nfs">NFS Volume Service</a>.</p>

To create and bind an instance for the volume service:

1. Create a service instance:
    * **NFS**: See [Create an NFS Volume Service](#create-nfs) below. 
    * **SMB**: See [Create an SMB Volume Service](#create-smb) below.

1. Bind your service instance to an app. Run: 

    ```
    cf bind-service YOUR-APP SERVICE-NAME -c GID-AND-UID-JSON MOUNT-PATH READ-ONLY-TRUE
    ```
    
    Where:
    * `YOUR-APP`: The name of the <%= vars.product_name %> app for which you want to use the volume service.
    * `SERVICE-NAME`: The name of the volume service instance you created in the previous step.

1. 
    * (NFS only) `GID-AND-UID-JSON`: If you bind an instance of the NFS volume service, you must supply two extra parameters: `gid` and `uid`. You can specify these parameters with the `-c` flag and a JSON string. The JSON can be inline or from a file. This parameter specifies the `gid` and `uid` to use when mounting the share to the app. `UID` and `GID` must be positive integer values.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For security reasons, nfs-volume v2.0.0 and later does not support `uid` and `gid` values of `0`.</p>
    * (Optional) `MOUNT-PATH`: To mount the volume to a particular path within your app rather than the default path, you supply the `mount` parameter. Choose a path with a root-level folder that already exists in the container, such as `/home`, `/usr`, or `/var`.
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Do not specify a <code>MOUNT-PATH</code> within the <code>/app</code> directory. For more information, see <a href="#mount-path">Mount Path Limitation</a>.</p>
    * (Optional) `READ-ONLY-TRUE`: When you issue the `cf bind-service` command, Volume Services mounts a read-write file system by default. You can specify a read-only mount by adding `"readonly":true` to the bind configuration JSON string.

    The following example shows binding `my-app` to the `nfs_service_instance` and specifying a read-only volume to be mounted to `/var/volume1`, passing an in-line JSON string:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf bind-service my-app nfs\_service\_instance -c '{"uid":"1000","gid":"1000","mount":"/var/volume1","readonly":true}'</pre>
    If you use an LDAP server, you must specify `username` and `password` instead of a UID and GID in this command. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf bind-service my-app nfs\_service\_instance -c '{"username":"user1000","password":"secret","mount":"/var/volume1","readonly":true}'</pre>

1. Run `cf restage YOUR-APP` to complete the service binding by restaging your app. Replace `YOUR-APP` with the name of your app.
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf restage YOUR-APP</pre>

### <a id='app'></a> Access the Volume Service from Your App

To access the volume service from your app, you must know which file path to use in your code. You can view the file path in the details of the service binding, which are available from the [VCAP_SERVICES](../deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#view-env) environment variable.

1. Run `cf env YOUR-APP` to view environment variables for your app. Replace `YOUR-APP` with the name of your app.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf env YOUR-APP
  "VCAP\_SERVICES": {
    "nfs": [
      {
        "credentials": {},
        "label": "nfs",
        "name": "nfs\_service\_instance",
        "plan": "Existing",
        "provider": null,
        "syslog\_drain\_url": null,
        "tags": [
          "nfs"
        ],
        "volume\_mounts": [
          {
            "container\_dir": "/var/vcap/data/153e3c4b-1151-4cf7-b311-948dd77fce64",
            "device\_type": "shared",
            "mode": "rw"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  </pre>

2. Use the properties under `volume_mounts` for any information your app needs. Refer to the following table:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Property
      </th>
      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>container\_dir</code></td>
      <td>String containing the path to the mounted volume that you bound to your app.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>device\_type</code></td>
      <td>The NFS volume release. This currently only supports <code>shared</code> devices. A <code>shared</code> device represents a distributed file system that can mount on all app instances simultaneously.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>mode</code></td>
      <td>String that informs what type of access your app has to NFS, either read-only, <code>ro</code>, or read and write, <code>rw</code>.
		</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

### <a id='manifest'></a> Bind with an App Manifest

You can also bind volume services using an app manifest as described in the [Services](../deploy-apps/manifest.html#services-block) section of the _Deploying with App Manifests_ topic. However, app manifests do not support bind configuration. If you want to bind a volume service using an app manifest, you must specify bind configuration when you create the service instance. The releases that support this are `nfs-volume` v1.3.1 and later and `smb-volume` v1.0.0 and later.

### <a id='mount-path'></a> Mount Path Limitation

Do not specify a `MOUNT-PATH` within the `/app` directory, which is where <%= vars.product_short %> unpacks the droplet. If you specify a mount inside the `/app` directory, the app may fail to start and parts of the app droplet may be written to the remote file share. This is because <%= vars.product_short %> mounts the volume before moving your compiled app into the droplet. 

If your app requires the shared volume to be placed within the `/app` directory:

1. Specify a mount volume in a location outside of the `/app` directory.

1. Create a symbolic link at app startup time, prior to launching the app. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">cf push YOUR-APP -c "ln -s /var/volume1 /app/volume1 && \$HOME/boot.sh"</pre>


## <a id='nfs'></a> NFS Volume Service

This section describes how to use the NFS volume service.

### <a id='create-nfs'></a> Create an NFS Volume Service

Cloud Foundry offers two NFS volume services:

* `nfs`: This volume service provides support for NFS volumes using both v3 and v4.x protocols.
  * If you do not specify a `version` parameter in the create configuration, the protocol version used is negotiated between client and server at mount time. This usually results in the latest available version being used.
  * If you want to request a specific protocol version, include a `version` parameter in the create configuration.
  * For read-only mounts, the driver enables attribute caching. This results in fewer attribute RPCs and better performance.
  * When you omit `uid` and `gid` or `username` and `password` in bind configuration, the driver skips `mapfs` mounting and performs just the normal kernel mount of the NFS file system without the overhead associated with FUSE mounts.

* `nfs-legacy` (deprecated): Although it is deprecated, this volume service is still available due to the difficulty of retiring services. If you use this service, it performs exactly the same mount as the `nfs` service.

Both services offer a single plan called `Existing`.

To create an NFS volume service, follow the procedure below that corresponds to your use case.

#### Create an `nfs` Service (Auto-Negotiated Version)

You can create a NFS volume service using the `Existing` plan of the `nfs` service. Run the following command:

```
$ cf create-service nfs Existing SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -c '{"share":"SERVER/SHARE"}'
```

Where:

* `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is a name you provide for this NFS volume service instance.
* `SERVER/SHARE` is the NFS address of your server and share.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure you omit the <code>:</code> that usually follows the server name in the address.</p>

You can run the `cf services` command to confirm that your newly-created NFS volume service displays in the output.

#### Create an `nfs` Service (Explicit Version)

You can create a NFS volume service with a specific NFS protocol version using the `Existing` plan of the `nfs` service. Run the following command:

```
$ cf create-service nfs Existing SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -c '{"share":"SERVER/SHARE", "version":"NFS-PROTOCOL"}'
```

Where:

* `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is a name you provide for this NFS volume service instance.
* `SERVER/SHARE` is the NFS address of your server and share.
* `VERSION` is the NFS protocol you want to use. For example, if you want to use NFSv4, set the version to `4.1`. Valid values are `3.0`, `4.0`, `4.1` or `4.2`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure you omit the <code>:</code> that usually follows the server name in the address.</p>

You can run the `cf services` command to confirm that your newly-created NFS volume service displays in the output.

#### Existing `nfs-legacy` Services:

With the release of NFS Volume Service v1.5.4, the original fuse-based NFS service has been deprecated in favor of the newer kernel mount-based NFS service. Existing NFS volume service bindings will now be listed as `nfs-legacy`. To switch over from `nfs-legacy` to the newer `nfs` service, Pivotal recommends you re-create and re-bind your `nfs` service instances.

With the release of NFS Volume Service v2.0.0, the `nfs-legacy` service has been rewritten to use the `nfs` service. To avoid being affected when the `nfs-legacy` service is retired, re-create and re-bind your service instances using the `nfs` service.

### <a id='nfs-sample'></a> Deploy and Bind a Sample App

This section describes how to deploy a sample app and bind it to the NFS volume service.

1. Clone the GitHub repository and push the `pora` test app:
  1. `cd ~/workspace`
  1. `git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/persi-acceptance-tests.git`
  1. `cd ~/workspace/persi-acceptance-tests/assets/pora`
  1. `cf push pora --no-start`

1. Bind the service to your app:

    ```
    $ cf bind-service pora SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -c '{"uid":"UID","gid":"GID"}'
    ```
    Where:
    * `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME`: The name of the volume service instance you created previously.
    * `UID` and `GID`: The `UID` and `GID` to use when mounting the share to the app. The NFS driver uses these values in the following ways:
      * When sending traffic to the NFS server, the NFS driver translates the app user ID and group ID to the `UID` and `GID` values.
      * When returning attributes from the NFS server, the NFS driver translates the `UID` and `GID` back to the running user UID and default GID. This allows you to interact with your NFS server as a specific user while allowing Cloud Foundry to run your app as an arbitrary user. `UID` and `GID` must be positive integer values.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In NFS v2.0.0 and later, `UID` and `GID` values of 0 are no longer permissible due to security reasons.</p>
    * **Optional paramenters**:
      * `mount`: Use this option to specify the path at which volumes mount to the app container. The default is an arbitrarily-named folder in `/var/vcap/data`. You may need to modify this value if your app has specific requirements. For example:

            ```
            cf bind-service pora myVolume -c '{"mount":"/var/path"}'
            ```
      * `readonly`: When you issue the `cf bind-service` command, Volume Services mounts a read-write file system by default. You can specify a read-only mount by adding `"readonly":true` to the bind configuration JSON string.

1. Start the app:

    ```
    $ cf start pora
    ```

1. Use the following `curl` command to confirm the app is running. The command returns an instance index for your app.

    ```
    $ curl http://pora.YOUR-CF-DOMAIN.com
    ```

1. Use the following `curl` command to confirm the app can access the shared volume. The command writes a file to the share and then reads it back out again.

    ```
    $ curl http://pora.YOUR-CF-DOMAIN.com/write
    ```

### <a id="nfs-additional"></a> Additional Information

This section provides additional information about using the NFS Volume Service.

#### <a id='ldap'></a> Configure LDAP Credentials with Service Instance Creation

If your Cloud Foundry deployment has LDAP enabled, you can configure LDAP credentials for your NFS Volume Service instance.

To configure LDAP credentials while creating your NFS Volume Service instance:

1. Specify values for `username` and `password` in the JSON string for your `cf create-service` command:
    ```
    $ cf create-service nfs PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -c '{"share":"SERVER/SHARE", "username":"USERNAME", "password":"PASSWORD"}'
    ```
    Where:
    * `PLAN` is the name of the service plan.
    * `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is a name you provide for this NFS Volume Service instance.
    * `SERVER/SHARE` is the NFS address of your server and share.
    * `USERNAME` is a username you provide for this NFS Volume Service instance.
    * `PASSWORD` is a password you provide for this NFS Volume Service instance.

#### <a id='bind-parameters'></a> Specify Bind Parameters During Service Instance Creation

As of `nfs-volume-release` v1.3.1, you can specify bind parameters in advance, when you create a service instance. Use this option if you bind the service to your app in an app manifest, where bind configuration is not supported.

#### <a id='flock'></a> File Locking with `flock()` and `lockf()`/`fcntl()`

Apps that use file locking through unix system calls such as `flock()` and `fcntl()` or script commands such as `flock` may use the `nfs` service. The `nfs-legacy` service uses a fuse mounting process that does not enforce locks across Diego Cells.


## <a id='smb'></a> SMB Volume Service

This section describes how to use a Server Message Block (SMB) volume service. For more information about SMB volume services, see [Microsoft SMB Protocol and CIFS Protocol Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/microsoft-smb-protocol-and-cifs-protocol-overview) in the Microsoft documentation.

### <a id='create-smb'></a> Create an SMB Volume Service

Cloud Foundry offers one SMB volume service:

* `smb`: This volume service provides support for existing SMB shares.

The service offers a single plan called `Existing`.

To create an SMB volume service, follow the procedure below.

#### Create with `smb` Service

You can create an SMB volume service using the `Existing` plan of the `smb` service. Run the following command:

```
$ cf create-service smb Existing SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -c '{"share":"//SERVER/SHARE"}'
```

Where:

* `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is a name you provide for this SMB volume service instance.
* `//SERVER/SHARE` is the SMB address of your server and share.

You can run the `cf services` command to confirm that your newly-created SMB volume service displays in the output.

### <a id='smb-sample'></a> Deploy and Bind a Sample App

This section describes how to deploy a sample app and bind it to the SMB volume service.

1. Clone the GitHub repository and push the `pora` test app:
  1. `cd ~/workspace`
  1. `git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/persi-acceptance-tests.git`
  1. `cd ~/workspace/persi-acceptance-tests/assets/pora`
  1. `cf push pora --no-start`

1. Bind the service to your app:

    ```
    $ cf bind-service pora SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -c '{"username":"USERNAME","password":"PASSWORD"}'
    ```
    Where:
    * `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME`: The name of the volume service instance you created previously.
    * `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`: The username and password to use when mounting the share to the app. This allows you to interact with your SMB server as a specific user while allowing Cloud Foundry to run your app as an arbitrary user.
    * **Optional parameters**:
      * `mount`: Use this option to specify the path at which volumes mount to the app container. The default is an arbitrarily-named folder in `/var/vcap/data`. You may need to modify this value if your app has specific requirements. For example:

            ```
            cf bind-service pora myVolume -c '{"username":"some-user","password":"some-password","mount":"/var/path"}'
            ```
      * `readonly`: When you issue the `cf bind-service` command, Volume Services mounts a read-write file system by default. You can specify a read-only mount by adding `"readonly":true` to the bind configuration JSON string.
      * `domain`: In case if your user is in windows domain you can specify `domain` parameter.

1. Start the app:

    ```
    $ cf start pora
    ```

1. Use the following `curl` command to confirm the app is running. The command returns an instance index for your app.

    ```
    $ curl http://pora.YOUR-CF-DOMAIN.com
    ```

1. Use the following `curl` command to confirm the app can access the shared volume. The command writes a file to the share and then reads it back out again.

    ```
    $ curl http://pora.YOUR-CF-DOMAIN.com/write
    ```
