<strong>WARNING</strong>:
The OMS Log Analytics Firehose Nozzle is currently intended for evaluation and test purposes only. Do not use this product in a production environment.
</p>

This topic explains how to integrate your Cloud Foundry (CF) apps with [OMS Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/).

Operations Management Suite (OMS) Log Analytics is a monitoring service for Microsoft Azure.
The OMS Log Analytics Firehose Nozzle is a CF component that forwards metrics from the Loggregator Firehose to OMS Log Analytics.

This topic assumes you are using the latest version of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) and a working <%= vars.product_full %> deployment on 
Azure.

## <a id='config'></a>Step 1: Create an OMS Workspace in Azure

See [Get started with Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-get-started) in the Microsoft Azure documentation to create an OMS workspace.

## <a id='deploy'></a>Step 2: Deploy the Nozzle to Cloud Foundry

1. Run `cf login -a https://api.YOUR-DOMAIN -u YOUR-USERNAME --skip-ssl-validation`, replacing `YOUR-DOMAIN` with your domain
and `YOUR-USERNAME` with your CF username, to authenticate to your CF instance. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf login -a https<span>:</span>//api.example.com -u admin --skip-ssl-validation</pre>

1. Follow the steps below to create a new Cloud Foundry user and grant it access to the Loggregator Firehose
using the UAA CLI (UAAC). <%= vars.uaa_cli %>

    1. Use `uaac target uaa.YOUR-DOMAIN` to target your UAA server:
      <pre class="terminal">$ uaac target uaa.example.com --skip-ssl-validation</pre>
    1. Run the following command to obtain an access token for the admin client:
      <pre class="terminal">$ uaac token client get admin</pre>
    1. Run `cf create-user USERNAME PASSWORD`, replacing `USERNAME` with a new username and `PASSWORD` with a password,
to create a new user. For example:
      <pre class="terminal">$ cf create-user firehose-user firehose-password</pre>
    1. Run `uaac member add cloud_controller.admin USERNAME`, replacing `USERNAME` with the new username, to grant the new
user admin permissions. For example:
      <pre class="terminal">$ uaac member add cloud_controller.admin firehose-user</pre>
    1. Run `uaac member add doppler.firehose USERNAME`, replacing `USERNAME` with the new username, to grant the new
user permission to read logs from the Loggregator Firehose endpoint. For example:
      <pre class="terminal">$ uaac member add doppler.firehose firehose-user</pre>

1. Download the [OMS Log Analytics Firehose Nozzle BOSH release](https://github.com/Azure/oms-log-analytics-firehose-nozzle) from Github.
Clone the repository and navigate to the `oms-log-analytics-firehose-nozzle` directory:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ git clone https<span>:</span>//github.com/Azure/oms-log-analytics-firehose-nozzle.git
    $ cd oms-log-analytics-firehose-nozzle
    </pre>

1. Push the app:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf push
    </pre>

## <a id='oms-portal'></a> Step 3: View Logs in OMS Portal

Import the Cloud Foundry OMS view to your OMS Portal to view visualized logs and metrics. You can also create alert rules for specific events.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The OMS view of Cloud Foundry is not yet available in the OMS Solutions Gallery. You can add it manually to view your logs in OMS Portal.</p>

### <a id='import-view'></a> Import the OMS View

1. From the main OMS Overview page, navigate to **View Designer**.
1. Click **Import**.
1. Click **Browse**.
1. Select the **Cloud Foundry (Preview).omsview** file.
1. Save the view. The main OMS Overview page displays the **Tile**.
1. Click the **Tile** to view visualized metrics.

See the [OMS Log Analytics View Designer documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-view-designer) for more information.

### <a id='alert'></a> Create Alert Rules

See [Understanding alerts in Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-alerts) for more information about OMS Log Analytics alerts.

### <a id='queries'></a> Set Alert Queries

This section includes example queries that operators can set in the OMS Portal.

* The following query alerts the operator when the nozzle sends a `slowConsumerAlert` to OMS:

    ```
    Type=CF_ValueMetric_CL Name_s=slowConsumerAlert
    ```

* The following query alerts the operator when Loggregator sends an `LGR` to indicate problems with the logging process:

    ```
    Type=CF_LogMessage_CL SourceType_s=LGR MessageType_s=ERR
    ```

* The following query alerts the operator when the number of lost events reaches a certain threshold, specified in the OMS Portal:

    ```
    Type=CF_CounterEvent_CL Job_s=nozzle Name_s=eventsLost
    ```

* The following query alerts the operator when the nozzle receives the `TruncatingBuffer.DroppedMessages` **CounterEvent**:

    ```
    Type=CF_CounterEvent_CL Name_s="TruncatingBuffer.DroppedMessages"
    ```

## <a id='additional-logging'></a> (Optional) Step 4: Configure Additional Logging

OMS Log Analytics Firehose Nozzle forwards metrics from the Loggregator Firehose to OMS with minimal processing,
but the nozzle can push additional metrics to OMS.

### <a id='events'></a> Log Sent, Received, and Lost Events

If you set the `LOG_EVENT_COUNT` environment variable to `TRUE` in the [manifest](#deploy), the nozzle periodically sends
the count of sent, received, and lost events to OMS. The value you set for the `LOG_EVENT_COUNT_INTERVAL` determines how
frequently the nozzle sends the count.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The nozzle does not count <strong>CounterEvents</strong> themselves in the sent, received, or lost event count.</p>

The nozzle sends the count as a **CounterEvent** with a **CounterKey** of one of the following:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>CounterEvent</th>
    <th>CounterKey</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>nozzle.stats.eventsReceived</td>
    <td>The number of events the Firehose has received during the interval</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>nozzle.stats.eventsSent</code></td>
    <td>The number of events the nozzle has successfully sent to OMS during the interval</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>nozzle.stats.eventsLost</code></td>
    <td>The number of events the nozzle has tried to send to OMS during the interval, but failed to send after 4 attempts</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In most cases, the total count of `eventsSent` plus `eventsLost` is less than the total `eventsReceived` at the same time.
The nozzle buffers some messages and posts them in a batch to OMS. Operators can adjust the buffer size by adjusting
the `OMS_BATCH_TIME` and `OMS_MAX_MSG_NUM_PER_BATCH` environment variables in the [manifest](#deploy).

### <a id='slow-consumer'></a> Log Slow Consumer Alerts

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The nozzle does not count <strong>ValueMetrics</strong> in the sent, received, or lost event count.</p>

Loggregator sends the nozzle a `slowConsumerAlert` in the following situations:

* WebSocket sends the error code `ClosePolicyViolation (1008)`
* The nozzle receives a **CounterEvent** with the value `TruncatingBuffer.DroppedMessages`

In either case, the nozzle sends the `slowConsumerAlert` event to OMS as the following **ValueMetric**:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ValueMetric</th>
    <th>MetricKey</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>nozzle.alert.slowConsumerAlert</code></td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

See the _Slow Nozzle Alerts_ section of the [Loggregator Guide for Cloud Foundry Operators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/log-ops-guide.html#slow-noz) for more information.

## <a id='scaling'></a> (Optional) Step 5: Scale the Deployment

### <a id='scale-nozzle'></a> Scale the Nozzle

If the nozzle is unable to keep up with processing logs from the Firehose, Loggregator alerts the nozzle.
When the nozzle receives the alert, it sends a `slowConsumerAlert` to OMS. If this happens, scaling up the nozzle minimizes data loss.

If an operator chooses to scale up their deployment, the Firehose evenly distributes events across all instances of the nozzle.
See the _Scaling Nozzles_ section of the [Loggregator Guide for Cloud Foundry Operators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/log-ops-guide.html#scaling-nozzles) for more information.

Operators can [create an alert rule](#alert) for the `slowConsumerAlert` message.

### <a id='scale-loggregator'></a> Scale Loggregator

Loggregator sends `LGR` log messages to indicate problems with the logging process.
See the _Scaling Loggregator_ section of the [Loggregator Guide for Cloud Foundry Operators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/log-ops-guide.html#scaling) for more information.

Operators can [create an alert rule](#alert) for the `LGR` message.
